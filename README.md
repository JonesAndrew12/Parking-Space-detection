# Parking-Space-detection
The project aims at detecting empty parking spaces using a camera and the state of the art object detection algorithm "YOLO V8".The output is integrated with the app so that the users can see whether spaces are available or not.This project can help malls and other public organisations to create a humanless parking system.
